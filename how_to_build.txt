Notice:
  We recommend using GIT Bash of https://git-scm.com/ to obtain the HLAE source
  code and also for applying the .patch files to libraries where neccessary.
  
  For some of the files required we have a backup on Google Drive:
  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4_pxNNt7RqmdXVmbUk0aVA3Qk0?resourcekey=0-5MvnHEezVZhY6pBoGpIt4g&usp=sharing
  But we recommend getting them from the original sources.


[X] Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community, which you can
    obtain for free from https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/ .
    (We are using 16.6.3 at the moment.)
    - Select Desktop .NET Desktop Development component
    - Select Desktop Development with C++ component
    - You'll need to install Wix Toolset Visual Studio 2019 Extension from
      within Visual Studio later.

[X]	Obtain Python 3.8.x from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ .
	We used python-3.8.3-amd64 .
	You will need to do the custom installation
	with pip and py launcher.
	
[X]	Obtain GNU gettext Windows binaries from https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/ .
	We used gettext0.20.1-iconv1.16-shared-64.exe .
	
[X] Install WiX Toolsetfrom https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/releases
	We used WiX Toolset v3.11.2.
	
[X] Currently it's required to change the PowerShell execution policy to
    RemoteSigned:
	https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7

[X] Obtain the HLAE source code from https://github.com/advancedfx/advancedfx into a
    folder you like, we'll call it <HLAESRC> from now on (by that I mean
    extract it so that you end up with the files like advancedfx.sln and directories
    in C:\<HLAESRC>\advancedfx folder).
    We recommend using the GIT Bash to obtain the source code, so you can
    easily fetch and merge updates from the advancedfx repository:
    cd /c/<HLAESRC>
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/advancedfx/advancedfx.git

[X] Open Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt:
	cd C:\<HLAESRC>\advancedfx\
	mkdir build
	cd build
	mkdir Release
	cd Release
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -T "v142" -A "Win32" ../..
	cmake --build . -v -- -r
	cmake --install . -v
	
[X] After that the installer and the zip can be found in "C:\<HLAESRC>\advancedfx\build\Release".

[X] Things you should do before releasing a new version:
  - Update version in hlae/CMakeLists.txt
  - Update GUIDs in hlae/UpdateCheck.cs
  - Update Product Version (and for "Major" release Id) in installer/HlaeCore/Product.wxs
  - Update version in installer/setup/Bundle.wxs
